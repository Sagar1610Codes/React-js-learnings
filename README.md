# React-js-learnings

Starting React Learnings

we can create react project with react only or with a framewok of vite as well

$ npx create-react-app Project-name // takes a lot of time as many modules are installed

bulky utility

but we can use vite to create project

$ npm create vite@latest



now in package json we can see the scripts we can run by, like with vite dev can run to browser

npm run dev

but we have to make elements to use in pages,

React.createElement(
    tag,
    {attributes},
    text in tag
)
